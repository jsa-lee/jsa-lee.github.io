                        For my Interactive Information Visualization course at the University of Washington 
                        Information School, I used Tableau to visualize the value of homes in various Washington 
                        State cities from 1996 to 2017. During this group project, we were tasked with creating 
                        an animated data visualization showing some sort of change over time (which was completely 
                        new to me). As a young adult and renter, I’m interested in exploring housing price trends 
                        which may affect the places I choose to rent in the future (or any homes I may consider 
                        purchasing outright).
   
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Our first task was to prep our dataset into a manageable format. The original dataset from 
                        Zillow Research was massive -- it included data for housing prices in all 50 states and was 
                        more than 1 gigabyte. We limited our usable dataset to just Washington State in particular, 
                        for convenience’s sake and also because every group member had some personal stake in the area.  
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        Next, I created a rough draft of the visualization in Tableau and conducted usability tests with 
                        members of a potential target audience. We tried to capture a variety of perspectives, so we 
                        interviewed everyone from students who had only rented to retirees who have purchased multiple 
                        homes in their lifetimes. Through those usability tests, I was able to create an improved version 
                        based on our interviewees’ suggestions, within the limits of my own ability.
                    </p>

                    <p>

                        In the future when I create interactive data visualizations, I will be sure to keep some of the 
                        suggestions I got in mind:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Account for and try to fix missing data in a dataset:</b> Despite our best efforts, some data 
                            values in our dataset were missing or otherwise difficult to work with. In the future, I will need 
                            to carefully prep my dataset and make my data as complete as possible in order to create the best 
                            possible visualization.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Compare with other, similar values:</b> Many of our interviewees wondered how housing prices 
                            in Washington State compared to those of different parts of the country, and if economic events 
                            like the 2008 recession affected all parts of the country similarly. We were unfortunately unable 
                            to include these due to time constraints, but if I had more time to dedicate to this project in 
                            the future, I would return to this dataset and include information such as a national or regional 
                            average home value.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                <div class="col-1"></div>
