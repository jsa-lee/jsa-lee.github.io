                        While part of the <a href="https://outintech.com/mentorship/"><b>Out in Tech Mentorship</b></a> Spring 2021 cohort, I designed a web app to collect 
                        and visualize personal data about time spent playing video games under the supervision of my 
                        mentor, <a href="https://jonathancb.design/"><b>Jonathan Corvin-Blackburn</b></a>. Over the course of eight weeks, I:   
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>conducted generative research using surveys and interviews I designed myself,</li>
                        <li>sketched out various ideas for web app features,</li>
                        <li>wireframed my web app in Figma,</li>
                        <li>conducted usability tests with members of my target audience, and</li>
                        <li>implemented their feedback in a mid-fidelity prototype.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Research</h3>

                    <img src="imgs/game-journal/research.png" alt="Survey and interview screenshots">

                    <p>
                        The first step I took was to conduct generative research into what my target audience wanted. 
                        After all, an idea I might find useful might not be what other players like me need. I created 
                        a preliminary survey using Google Forms that received 32 responses and learned that:   
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>87.5% of respondents played games on a personal computer,</li>
                        <li>90% of respondents used Steam to manage their digital games library,</li>
                        <li>More than 50% of respondents did not consciously track the time they spent playing games,</li>
                        <li>When asked about concerns related to using a journaling app, the vast majority of 
                            respondents expressed concern about forgetting to add entries to their virtual journal, 
                            compared with only about 23% of respondents who were concerned about their account 
                            security.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>
                        I also interviewed survey respondents who were interested in speaking further about their 
                        experiences, and learned that what they wanted to learn from a journaling app was different 
                        than what I had expected from other types of journaling apps. While I had focused solely on 
                        visualizing time spent in-game and comparing that between different titles or consoles, my 
                        interviewees wanted to use a journaling app to record their thoughts over periods of time, 
                        closer to a diary. They also wanted to use the journaling app to manage their gaming time 
                        and make sure they were not spending large amounts of time binge-playing games. The insights 
                        I discovered from both my surveys and interviews informed my design process when I began to 
                        ideate and sketch out key features for my web app.    
                    </p>

                        My initial sketches for data entry followed a more traditional form entry format, but I also 
                        explored a “storytelling” sentence completion data entry format like a “Mad Libs” worksheet. 
                        Based on the insight from my interviews where users were interested in using the web app like 
                        a diary, as well as my own desire to distance the web app from work, I tried to ideate features 
                        that were more playful and creative. I also sketched out in detail how data entry fields would 
                        autofill based on previous input or third-party database integration -- I wanted the form to 
                        autocomplete certain fields such as game titles or console names. Finally, I explored different 
                        ways to visualize the data including bar charts, pie charts, heat maps, and even emoji clouds 
                        (this was one I found the most playful and interesting to look at).
                    </p>

                    <img src="imgs/game-journal/lo-fi.png" alt="Low-fidelity wireframes">

                    <p>
                        Next, I implemented my sketches and initial ideas in a low-fidelity wireframe on Figma. At 
                        this point in time, I was unconcerned about design aspects like fonts and color schemes -- 
                        I just wanted to show how each feature worked, and even annotated certain sections using red 
                        text. I was then able to conduct guided usability tests with survey respondents who expressed 
                        interest in returning for further interviewing. The most important improvements my testers 
                        asked for were:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Customizing data visualization color schemes:</b> This would not only help create a distinct 
                            color scheme for my web app, but also make the journaling app more personal (like a diary). 
                            I went on a color palette generator side and picked some nice-looking categorical color 
                            schemes for my graphs.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Dark mode:</b> One tester mentioned that they exclusively used dark mode on websites and 
                            apps that offered the alternate color scheme due to migraines they would get from looking 
                            at bright screens for extended periods of time. This also reminded me to keep 
                            accessibility in mind when designing my web app, so that all types of people can use my 
                            journaling website (not just the able-bodied).
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Font for dyslexic users:</b> As above, testers expressed their desire for a dyslexia-friendly 
                            font that would make it easier to navigate large blocks of text. I looked into adding 
                            options for fonts like OpenDyslexic but also other dyslexia-friendly fonts like Comic 
                            Sans.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>More descriptive tracker entry titles:</b> Before, I was saving game time entries only by the 
                            date and time they were entered. Testers noted that it would be very hard to keep track of 
                            distinct entries when the titles all looked the same. I added the title of the game played 
                            in the data entry title to make them more distinct but still follow an organized format, 
                            but in the future I might also explore ways to let users name the entries themselves.
                        </li>
                        <li><b>Customize types of data visualizations:</b> I asked testers whether pie or bar charts helped 
                            them understand their game time more, but they all had different answers for which ones 
                            they found the most useful. I then realized that because every user might want to use a 
                            journaling app like this for a different reason (for example, to understand the types of 
                            games they tend to play v.s. managing their time spent gaming overall). In the future, 
                            I would iterate on different ways to allow users to choose the types of graphs they can 
                            view in the data visualization section of the web app.
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>What I learned</h3>

                    <p>
                        Over the course of this project, I learned three important lessons:
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <b>Accessible data visualization:</b> Initially, I was designing some more complicated types 
                            of data visualizations for my apps such as area charts and heat maps. However, I realized 
                            that the people I was testing my app with didn’t understand how to read these more 
                            advanced graphs and preferred simpler options like pie charts and bar charts. In my haste 
                            to prove my advanced knowledge of data visualization, I forgot that data visualizations 
                            are only useful when readers can interpret them. When visualizing data in the future, I 
                            need to remember to pick my graphs based on my target audience.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <b>A11y-centered design:</b> My testers often mentioned the desire for options that would improve 
                            readability due to certain temporary and permanent disabilities. As a relatively 
                            able-bodied person, I had only thought to make sure I could interpret my own prototypes 
                            when creating them. In the future, I need to continue to add features that will help all 
                            types of users use my products, not just the able-bodied ones.

                            <b>Games should be fun:</b> From various seminars and articles I watched and read on games user 
                            experience, the big difference between games and other types of software is that games 
                            should be fun to play. Throughout the course of this project, I tried to make sure that 
                            this games-adjacent product is fun to use, and that filling in the forms doesn’t feel 
                            like work. In fact, the biggest reason I abandoned the traditional form entry format was 
                            that it began to seem too close to clocking in at work. If users began to see gaming time 
                            journaling as a job, I would have failed in my responsibility to design a supplement 
                            product for gaming, a fun hobby. To that end, I added playful aspects like a “Mad Libs” 
                            data entry form, as well as an emoji selection screen to gauge sentiment over time. In 
                            the future, I would add even more playful components to this web app in order to make 
                            keeping track of playtime a fun activity in and of itself.
